- What is a transit? : A simple explanation here: [here](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/alien-worlds/ways-to-find-a-planet/?intent=021#/2)
- What is 'transit depth' and a spectrum? -- The Exoplanet Handbook (Perryman 2018) gives a good overview of transit and spectroscopy (Chap. 6, Sec. 6.12 and Chap. 11, 11.6), alternatively, have a look at [Winn (2010)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1001.2010v5)
- What is an observation? What is a light curve? -- The [Science](https://www.ariel-datachallenge.space/workshop2024/documentation/about) session gives a nice introduction to the topic, of course, the Ariel redbook is useful on that as well.
- Publications that could be useful -- some of you may have posted these already [link](https://www.ariel-datachallenge.space/ML/documentation/resources)
- Differences between Train - test distribution. Long story short, yes, certain aspects of the test data distribution are deliberately made different from the training set. So don't be too surprised if your local score is different from your leaderboard score. We follow the same philosophy as outlined [here](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v220/yip23a/yip23a.pdf), section 2.2.1
- [Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gordonyip/calibrating-astronomical-data) on Calibrating Data by Batch , [Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gordonyip/calibrating-a-single-observation) on calibrating a single observation.
- [Starter solution](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gordonyip/adc-2024-starter-solution) - there are also plenty notebooks available in the code section.
- Follow us on [Twitter/X](https://x.com/ArielTelescope) - we will be sharing our updates there, stay tuned!
