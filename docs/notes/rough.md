        ## Recommended State-of-the-Art Models for Exoplanet Atmospheric Spectra Extraction
        
        Given the complexity and nature of the dataset for the ARIEL mission competition, the following state-of-the-art (SOTA) models are well-suited for extracting atmospheric spectra from noisy, sequential 2D images:
        
        ### 1. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Temporal Modeling**
        
        - **Description:** CNNs excel at extracting spatial features from image data. When combined with temporal models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks or Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), they can effectively handle the sequential nature of the data.
        - **Why Suitable:** The dataset consists of time-series images from two instruments. A CNN can process each image to extract relevant features, while an LSTM or TCN can model the temporal dependencies across the sequence of frames.
        - **Example Architectures:**
            - **CNN-LSTM:** Integrates CNNs for spatial feature extraction with LSTMs for capturing temporal dynamics.
            - **CNN-TCN:** Combines CNNs with TCNs to leverage their ability to model long-range temporal dependencies.
        
        ### 2. **U-Net Architecture**
        
        - **Description:** U-Net is a type of convolutional autoencoder originally designed for biomedical image segmentation. It has an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections that preserve spatial information.
        - **Why Suitable:** The U-Net can be adapted for denoising and feature extraction from noisy images. Its architecture allows for precise localization and reconstruction of the underlying signal, which is essential for extracting faint atmospheric spectra.

            - Improved feature reuse reduces the number of parameters.
        
        ### 6. **Hybrid Models Combining CNNs and Gaussian Processes (GPs)**
        
        - **Description:** Combines the feature extraction capabilities of CNNs with the probabilistic modeling of GPs.
        - **Why Suitable:** While CNNs handle the extraction of meaningful features from image data, GPs can provide uncertainty estimates for the extracted spectra, aligning with the competition's requirement for uncertainty quantification.
        - **Advantages:**
            - Combines deep learning with probabilistic modeling.
            - Provides robust uncertainty estimates alongside predictions.

    Given this additional context about your data, I can provide a more targeted recommendation. Your dataset sounds complex, with multiple dimensions: planets (samples), timestamps (temporal dimension), spectral dimensions, and spatial dimensions. This type of data is often referred to as hyperspectral time series data. For such a dataset, here are some suitable transformer models:
    
    1. 3D-ViT (3D Vision Transformer):
    This would be excellent for handling the spatial and spectral dimensions together with the temporal aspect. It can process 3D data effectively, which aligns well with your hyperspectral time series.
    2. 2. Spectral-Temporal Attention Network (STAN):
    While not a pure transformer, this model combines CNN and transformer components to handle both spectral and temporal dimensions of hyperspectral time series data.
    3. Swin Transformer:
    This hierarchical vision transformer could be adapted to handle your multi-dimensional data, especially if you can reshape your data into a 2D or 3D grid-like structure.
    4. TimeSFormer:
    Although primarily designed for video, it could be adapted for your spectral-temporal data, treating the spectral dimension similar to how it treats spatial dimensions in video.
    5. Perceiver IO:
    This is a very flexible architecture that can handle arbitrary input and output dimensions, which could be well-suited to your complex data structure.
    6. FNet:
    This is a simpler and faster alternative to full attention mechanisms, which might be beneficial given the large size of your dataset (800 planets * 11k timestamps).
    
    Given the specifics you've provided, I would lean towards recommending the 3D-ViT or a custom architecture that combines elements of ViT and TimeSFormer to handle both the spectral-spatial and temporal aspects of your data efficiently.

    I apologize for the overly general response earlier. You're absolutely right to ask for more specific model names. Let me provide some exact model names that could be relevant for your time series spectroscopy data:
    
    1. TimeSformer: As you mentioned, this is indeed a relevant model. It's designed for video understanding but could be adapted for your spectral time series data.
    2. ViViT (Video Vision Transformer): Another video-based model that could be repurposed for your spectral data sequences.
    3. Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN): Specifically designed for time series data.
    4. WaveNet: Originally for audio generation, but has been adapted for various time series tasks.
    5. DeepONet: A deep learning framework for learning operators, which could be useful for mapping between function spaces (like your spectral data).
    6. Informer: A efficient long-sequence time series forecasting model.
    7. TFT (Temporal Fusion Transformers): Designed for interpretable time series prediction.
    8. N-BEATS: Neural basis expansion analysis for interpretable time series forecasting.
    9. DeepAR: Amazon's probabilistic forecasting model using autoregressive RNNs.
    10. Prophet: While not a deep learning model, it's worth mentioning for time series analysis.
    11. ROCKET (RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform): A time series classification algorithm that could potentially be adapted for your task.
    12. TST (Time Series Transformer): A transformer architecture specifically designed for time series data.
    
    For your specific task of extracting exoplanet spectra from noisy time series data, you might need to adapt these models or combine them in novel ways. For example, you could use a TimeSformer or ViViT architecture as the backbone, but modify the input processing to handle your spectral data instead of video frames.
    
    Would you like me to elaborate on how any of these models could be adapted for your specific exoplanet spectroscopy task?
